Spatika is a project started by KUWSDB that aims to bring transparency to financial transactions within the organization and provide easy access to information about projects and their progress to the public. The project is named after a type of stone called "spatika", known for its purity and transparency.
Spatika has several components, including an online billing system for contractors to submit their bills, automatic syncing of financial data between different systems, and the ability to generate and access reports at different levels. The project also allows the public to access information about project status, fund utilization, and progress through a mobile app and website. It provides a way for the public to give feedback through social media and analytics. The overall goal of Spatika is to increase transparency and accountability in KUWSDB's financial transactions and project management.
